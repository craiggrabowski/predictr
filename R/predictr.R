#' predictr: A package for fast model predictions
#'
#' The predictr package provides adaptors which convert standard
#' model objects into a new type of object.
#' This new object stores the minimal amount of data required to
#' run model predictions,
#' and these new predictions reproduce the results of the
#' \code{predict} method with greater speed and with less memory
#' usage.
